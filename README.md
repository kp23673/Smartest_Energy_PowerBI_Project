# Smartest_Energy_PowerBI_Project

## About the Company  
**Smartest Energy** is a data-driven energy solutions provider focused on optimizing energy metering and consumption. The company collaborates with multiple meter providers, including **Energy Industries, Metered ConneXions, Electric Inc, and Power Meters Ltd**, to ensure efficient energy distribution and monitoring. With a commitment to sustainability and operational efficiency, Smartest Energy leverages analytics to enhance decision-making and improve energy management.  

## Objective for this Project  
The objective of this project is to analyze metering insights from August 2021 to July 2022 using Power BI. It aims to provide a clear understanding of meter gains, losses, energy consumption trends, and supply status to optimize energy distribution and operational efficiency. 

## Insights
- **Meters Gained vs. Lost**: A net gain of **618 meters** was recorded, with a **6.51% loss rate** over the year.
- **Energy Consumption**: Total energy consumption reached **220.38M kWh** in the year.
- **Quarterly Meter Loss**: Losses varied by quarter, primarily attributed to **end of contract, meter removal, and termination**.
- **Company Performance**: The highest meter gains were recorded by **Energy Industries (203 meters)**, while **Electric Inc (142 meters)** and **Power Meters Ltd (102 meters)** also showed notable contributions.
- **Consumption Trends**: Peak consumption was observed in **October 2021 (39.6M kWh)** and **April 2022 (26.1M kWh)**, with significant fluctuations across months.
